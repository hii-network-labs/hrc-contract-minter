@dev https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712[EIP-712] is a standard for hashing and signing of typed structured data.\n The encoding scheme specified in the EIP requires a domain separator and a hash of the typed structured data, whose\n encoding is very generic and therefore its implementation in Solidity is not feasible, thus this contract\n does not implement the encoding itself. Protocols need to implement the type-specific encoding they need in order to\n produce the hash of their typed data using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`.\n This contract implements the EIP-712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding\n scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA\n ({_hashTypedDataV4}).\n The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating\n the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain.\n NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as \"v4\", as implemented by the JSON RPC method\n https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html[`eth_signTypedDataV4` in MetaMask].\n NOTE: In the upgradeable version of this contract, the cached values will correspond to the address, and the domain\n separator of the implementation contract. This will cause the {_domainSeparatorV4} function to always rebuild the\n separator from the immutable values, which is cheaper than accessing a cached version in cold storage.\n

Strings of arbitrary length can be optimized using this library if they are short enough (up to 31 bytes) by packing them with their length (1 byte) in a single EVM word (32 bytes). Additionally, a fallback mechanism can be used for every other case. Usage example: ```solidity contract Named {     using ShortStrings for *;     ShortString private immutable _name;     string private _nameFallback;     constructor(string memory contractName) {         _name = contractName.toShortStringWithFallback(_nameFallback);     }     function name() external view returns (string memory) {         return _name.toStringWithFallback(_nameFallback);     } } ```\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"src/contracts/utils/ShortStrings.sol\":\"ShortStrings\"},\"evmVersion\":\"paris\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"src/contracts/utils/ShortStrings.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xca61746758e4e13485a4facdfc1a3007e6f9484463134d9d0c5fe01470b5fd86\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://e2ad8b2282aa23ed7c6d48354190aa20c873d96a5e2d109155e34730ae4f7680\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmZahVacChaavMC1SJppFaGvQ7Mdth1tgsAc5hVXz3TjdW\"]},\"src/contracts/utils/StorageSlot.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x8449f29f442de20ee32b814b1c995116dc5eb0653c641796a88a91c373ff525d\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://6ecc81a35d3dc89b146910b9673512bfbf75b477d904d88e9ba37e08cdb8c1e8\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmQEQC4sKmfvaBXqwsUFj2X1PkS3A2cicGQ9y2FUXg97HK\"]}},\"version\":1}"}},"src/contracts/utils/StorageSlot.sol":{"StorageSlot":{"abi":[],"evm":{"bytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"linkReferences":{},"object":"60566037600b82828239805160001a607314602a57634e487b7160e01b600052600060045260246000fd5b30600052607381538281f3fe73000000000000000000000000000000000000000030146080604052600080fdfea26469706673582212205d3fa425d1f25196f7d10101059d52ac7977a8c4f899f63b128bb790bac1fd6b64736f6c63430008180033","opcodes":"PUSH1 0x56 PUSH1 0x37 PUSH1 0xB DUP3 DUP3 DUP3 CODECOPY DUP1 MLOAD PUSH1 0x0 BYTE PUSH1 0x73 EQ PUSH1 0x2A JUMPI PUSH4 0x4E487B71 PUSH1 0xE0 SHL PUSH1 0x0 MSTORE PUSH1 0x0 PUSH1 0x4 MSTORE PUSH1 0x24 PUSH1 0x0 REVERT JUMPDEST ADDRESS PUSH1 0x0 MSTORE PUSH1 0x73 DUP2 MSTORE8 DUP3 DUP2 RETURN INVALID PUSH20 0x0 ADDRESS EQ PUSH1 0x80 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG2 PUSH5 0x6970667358 0x22 SLT KECCAK256 TSTORE EXTCODEHASH LOG4 0x25 0xD1 CALLCODE MLOAD SWAP7 0xF7 0xD1 ADD ADD SDIV SWAP14 MSTORE 0xAC PUSH26 0x77A8C4F899F63B128BB790BAC1FD6B64736F6C63430008180033 ","sourceMap":"1247:2774:33:-:0;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;-1:-1:-1;;;1247:2774:33;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"},"deployedBytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"immutableReferences":{},"linkReferences":{},"object":"73000000000000000000000000000000000000000030146080604052600080fdfea26469706673582212205d3fa425d1f25196f7d10101059d52ac7977a8c4f899f63b128bb790bac1fd6b64736f6c63430008180033","opcodes":"PUSH20 0x0 ADDRESS EQ PUSH1 0x80 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG2 PUSH5 0x6970667358 0x22 SLT KECCAK256 TSTORE EXTCODEHASH LOG4 0x25 0xD1 CALLCODE MLOAD SWAP7 0xF7 0xD1 ADD ADD SDIV SWAP14 MSTORE 0xAC PUSH26 0x77A8C4F899F63B128BB790BAC1FD6B64736F6C63430008180033 ","sourceMap":"1247:2774:33:-:0;;;;;;;;"},"methodIdentifiers":{}},"metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.8.24+commit.e11b9ed9\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[],\"devdoc\":{\"details\":\"Library for reading and writing primitive types to specific storage slots.
